                        (Ephesians 2:1-10 NKJV) And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins... 
                        For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.

                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        There has been a huge change in your life. You have moved from being "dead in trespasses and sins" 
                        to being "alive together with Christ". God's life, which is "eternal life" has been put into your heart. 
                        God has come to live in you and be at home in your life...
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-4">Freedom From Control</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        Before becoming a Christian, you were controlled by "the prince of the power of the air" - the Devil. 
                        He had influence over your life, but now, through Christ, his control is broken...
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-4">God's Purpose For You</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        God saves you for a purpose - to live a holy and responsible life. "For we are His workmanship, created 
                        in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them" (Ephesians 2:10)...
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-4">Living As A New Creation</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        Your transformation means you must actively put your new life into practice every day. 
                        Walk in faith, love, and obedience to Christ, knowing that He has a plan for you...
