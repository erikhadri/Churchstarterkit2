                        <em>"(Matthew 7:7 NKJV) 'Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.'" </em><br><br>
                        This is the basic secret of becoming a Christian - you have to want to follow Jesus. I can't make you follow Jesus, no one can. It's between you and God. In your seeking there are a few facts that make the journey a whole lot easier and quicker.

                        We call this set of facts "the good news of Jesus Christ" or "the gospel" for short. This article is about the gospel and attempts to give you a few facts to help you believe.

                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        Everyone, absolutely everyone has fallen short of God's glorious holy standards for their lives. You might not have murdered but you probably have lied. You may not have slept with someone else's wife or husband - but you probably have hated someone or been unjust or cruel. Sin is not just sexual sin or murder, it includes being greedy, jealous, and envious. It includes our thought life too! All that we think in our imaginations is known to God. That is why Paul the apostle can write: (Romans 3:23 NKJV) "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God". All includes me and it also includes you.

                    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-4">Fact 2: God Punishes Sin</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        God is holy and just, therefore He punishes sin. The Bible says: (Romans 6:23 NKJV) "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Sin carries the death penalty. There are two kinds of death referred to in the Bible - physical death and eternal spiritual death. Eternal spiritual death means going into torment in Hell forever and ever, it means separation from God, from goodness, from truth, from sanity, from happiness and light. It is eternal torment and disintegration.

                    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-4">Fact 3: Jesus Took Our Punishment</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        Jesus took our punishment for sin when He died upon the Cross. God prepared a way for sin to be dealt with - through special sacrifices. In the Jewish sacrificial system this was a perfect animal without spot or blemish. Jesus was sinless and was the perfect sacrifice for all the sins of all people for all time. The Bible tells us that God saw that everyone had sinned and was in danger of Hell. He decided to rescue them by sending Jesus to die instead of them.

                    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-4">Fact 4: How to Become a Christian</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        The way to become a Christian is by living by two key truths. These key truths are that Jesus Christ is Lord and that He rose from the dead. The first says that He is boss of your life, of your family, and even of the government. Jesus Christ is the "ultimate authority"; He must be obeyed. Once you become a Christian you are like a soldier under the command of Jesus Christ. However, His commands are not petty or small-minded. His commands are life-giving, true, and the way to salvation and a fulfilling life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        The second thing we have to live by is that Jesus Christ rose from the dead. This means that we accept that He lived (how else did He die?), that He died (how else did He rise from the dead?), and that God raised Him from the dead on the third day. This means that we too will be raised from the dead to have a life that lasts for eternity and shares the joy of heaven.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        If you would like to become a Christian, then please pray the following prayer:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6 font-light text-white">
                        Dear God, I would like to become a Christian. I know that I have not lived as you want me to. I know I need you to forgive me for all the sins I have done. I ask that you will please forgive me because of what Jesus did on the cross. I believe He died on that cross to take my sins and that You raised Him from the dead. I want to have eternal life from God so that I can follow Jesus and obey Him forever as my Lord. Please make me a Christian now. Amen.
